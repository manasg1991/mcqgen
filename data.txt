The Key Word and Other Mysteries is a collection of mystery short stories by American author Isaac Asimov, featuring his boy detective Larry. The book was illustrated by Rod Burke. It was first published in hardcover by Walker & Company in 1977, and in paperback by Avon Books in 1979. A British edition illustrated by Geoff Taylor and adding one additional story was issued by Pan Books in 1982.

The book contains five stories by Asimov (six in the British edition). Most were reprinted from magazines, but one was written for the book.

Larry appeared in seven other stories, five of which appear in The Disappearing Man and Other Mysteries. (The eleventh Larry story, "Zip Code," from Boys' Life September 1986, does not appear in any book, and the twelfth and final story, "A Friend Calls," was never published.)[1]
